  input_structure: |
    Plain text:
    "What is a zero-day vulnerability?"
    "Summarize the latest ransomware threats"

    Structured JSON:
    {
      "question": "What is CVE-2024-12345?",
      "detail_level": "brief|detailed|comprehensive"
    }

  output_format: |
    Standard response (JSON):
